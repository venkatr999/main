        <h1>COVID-19 vaccines: everything you need to know</h1>
        <h3><p>Now that COVID-19 vaccines have reached billions of people worldwide,
            the evidence is overwhelming that no matter which one you take,
            the vaccines offer life-saving protection against a disease that has killed millions.
             The pandemic is far from over, and they are our best bet of staying safe.
             The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, locally known as Covishield, is made from a weakened version of a 
             common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus -
              although it can't cause illness.
           Covaxin by Indian firm Bharat Biotech is an inactivated vaccine which means that it is made up of killed
            coronaviruses, making it safe to be injected into the body.

       The vaccine ran into controversy after India's regulators gave it emergency approval in January while the
        third phase of the trial was still underway, sparking scepticism and questions from experts. Bharat Biotech, 
        which makes the vaccine, has since published data suggesting 78% efficacy.
